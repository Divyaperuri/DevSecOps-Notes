*DevOps*
DevOps: DevOps(Developer + Operations) is a Process of improving the delivery of applications by ensuring the 
proper automation with application quality maintained, Continuous Monitoring and testing.
Why DevOps?
* Ten years ago, if the company delivered the application to a customer, there were some steps to follow for this delivery of the application.
* Developer(Will develop the code) → In Central Repository → Run the application in Server → This should be done by SysAdmin →
BRE (Build and Release Engineer) → He will deploy the application on to the Server → Server Admin(Use to create the App Server, 
which means application has to hold that application) → Then it will goes to Production(Customer)
grep - to findout the word in particular file
grep -i : to find out the word even it is insensitive
grep -v : unmatch of that word
grep -c  : to count the word
grep -n : to get the word line number also
grep -i -c : to count the word even it is case insensitive

head - to get the top 10 lines
tail - to get the bottom 10 lines
tail -f logfile name --> but need to get into root user to get the log details
If we want to search the word from any file need to use this command - cat <file name> | grep <word search>
head 'filename' ---> By default will get the top 10 lines
tail 'filename' --> By default will get the bottom 10 lines
head -n 5 'filename' --> will give the top 5 lines
tail -n 3 'filename' --> will give the bottom 3 lines
head -n 5 'filename' | tail -n 3 --> will get the inbetween lines
