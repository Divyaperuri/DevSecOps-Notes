*DevOps*
DevOps: DevOps(Developer + Operations) is a Process of improving the delivery of applications by ensuring the 
proper automation with application quality maintained, Continuous Monitoring and testing.
Why DevOps?
* Ten years ago, if the company delivered the application to a customer, there were some steps to follow for this delivery of the application.
* Developer(Will develop the code) → In Central Repository → Run the application in Server → This should be done by SysAdmin →
BRE (Build and Release Engineer) → He will deploy the application on to the Server → Server Admin(Use to create the App Server, 
which means application has to hold that application) → Then it will goes to Production(Customer)
grep - to findout the word in particular file
grep -i : to find out the word even it is insensitive
grep -v : unmatch of that word
grep -c  : to count the word
grep -n : to get the word line number also
grep -i -c : to count the word even it is case insensitive
$ -- indicates the ending line of the word
^ -- indicates the starting line of the word in grep
head - to get the top 10 lines
tail - to get the bottom 10 lines
tail -f logfile name --> but need to get into root user to get the log details
If we want to search the word from any file need to use this command - cat <file name> | grep <word search>
head 'filename' ---> By default will get the top 10 lines
tail 'filename' --> By default will get the bottom 10 lines
head -n 5 'filename' --> will give the top 5 lines
tail -n 3 'filename' --> will give the bottom 3 lines
head -n 5 'filename' | tail -n 3 --> will get the inbetween lines
echo --> it wil print the output what we have given
cut --> to cut the link into fragments
echo "url link" | cut -d "/" -f1 --> Here it will get the i/p from echo and then it will cut the link into fragments
cut -d ":" -f1 "/etc/passwd --> Will cut the fragments from files
awk --> Here will get the last word of that link no need of counting
echo "url link" | awk -F "/" '{print $NF}' --> Here will get the i/p from the echo and awk will give the last fragment or else we can give the number in N
awk -F ":" {print $1F)' /etc/passwd --> From this we get the users from the file
awk -F ":" '{print $1F,$3F}' /etc/passwd --> will get the first user and their 3rd rowm i.e id number from the file
vi -> visually improved
vim ---> It is more used in editors , here vi or vim are same
vim --> To create the file and we can edit as per our requirement but in "cat" command its unable to edit the file
Here in this we have 3 modes :
1.Command or Colon mode 2.Escape mode 3.Insert mode
Steps to do edit:
1.First we need click escape button then i to write the file
2.after that
-->i - To insert
-->q - Quit without saving
-->:q! - Forceable quit
-->:wq! - Save the file and quit
-->:set nu - Will get the line numbers
-->:<line num> - To change the cursor to another required line.
--> :/<Seraching word> - To SEARCH the word from top to bottom
--> :?<searching word> - To search the word from bottom to top
--> :<line num>d - To delete the particular line
--> :noh - To unhighlight
--> :%d - To delete everything
--> :s/<word-search>/<replace word> -- To search the word and it will replace it
--> :<line-number>s/<word-search>/<replace word> - It will search the word in given line number and replace
--> :<line-num>s/<word-search>/<replace word>/g - It will search the word and replace all occurences
--> gg - To move to top wherver we are
--> Shift + g - To move to bottom wherever we are
--> u - To undo the edits
--> ctrl + r -- Redo
--> dd - To delete the lines
--> yy - To copy the line
--> p - Paste the line below the line
--> shift + p - Paste the line above
